# Atomic design architecture

Great architecture to use in designs development

## Layers:

[ atoms ] -> [ molecules ] -> [ organisms ] -> [ templates ] -> [ pages ]


Really close to modular architecture with the same advantages and disadvantages plus:

- No clear business orientation, working with abstract atoms, molecules, organisms
